# SJTUTTA_ADMIN
It's a member management & activity logger built on Raspberry 3 B+.

It's still under development so don't expect anything from it.

# Features
Identity recognition using PN 532

Print some info on the e-Paper Hat

# Remarks
Since e-ink screen has a relatively LOW dpi, it's better to use BitmapFonts. 

However, PIL itself does NOT support Bitmap-Font that contains more than 256 characters. (See [#3907](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/3907))
